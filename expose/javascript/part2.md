1. prints 3 because i increments from 0, 1, 2, and then to 3 before failing the for condition
2. prints 150 because it takes the value of the last discountedPrice in for loop which is 300*(1-0.5) = 150
3. prints 150 because it takes value of last finalPrice in for loop
4. [50, 100, 150] because the function applies the 0.5 discount to each element in prices
5. error, cannot print i outside the definition of i inside the for loop
6. error, cannot print discountedPrice outside the definition of discountedPrice inside the for loop
7. prints 150 because it takes value of last finalPrice in for loop, console.log(finalPrice) is called within the block in which finalPrice is defined
8. [50, 100, 150] because the function applies the 0.5 discount to each element in prices, discounted is returned in same block where it is defined by let
9. error, cannot print i outside the definition of i inside the for loop
10. prints length of prices which is 3, because console.log(length) is within block in which length is defined by const
11. [50, 100, 150] because the function can manipulate const discounted via push, but not reassign it
